# Site

This site is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static site generator.

## Installation

```bash
yarn
```

## Local Development

```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

Deployment is automated through GitHub Actions CI/CD to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch.
