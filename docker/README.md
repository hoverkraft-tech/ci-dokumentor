# Docker Implementation for CI Dokumentor

This directory holds the Docker build and related assets for CI Dokumentor.

Full usage and operational documentation has been consolidated into the project's docs site.

See: [../packages/docs/content/integrations/docker.md](the complete Docker documentation) for quickstart, CI examples, and troubleshooting.

If you need to modify the Dockerfile or local build process, update the docs there as well.
